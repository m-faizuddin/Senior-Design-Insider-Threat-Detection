### Offline XGBoost Model
This repository contains the Semester 1 deliverables for the CS492 AI-Based Insider Threat Detection project:
a complete offline machine-learning pipeline for detecting insider threats using the CERT r4.2 Insider Threat Dataset.

The goal of this semester is to:
-build a reproducible modeling pipeline
-perform feature optimization
-tune a high-recall and high-precision classifier
-calibrate model thresholds
-prepare for deployment in Semester 2

All modeling was performed offline on static CERT logs.
