# AI-Based Insider Threat Detection
## Mohammed Faizudden, Anna Wille, Maya Wyganowska
This repository contains the Semester 1 deliverable for the CERTML project:
a complete offline machine-learning pipeline for detecting insider threats using the CERT Insider Threat Dataset.

The goal of this phase is to:
-build a reproducible modeling pipeline
-perform feature optimization
-tune a high-recall and high-precision classifier
-calibrate model thresholds
-prepare for deployment in Semester 2

All modeling was performed offline on static CERT logs.
